                        <p>When I was visiting Tokyo in 2017, I had a mini heart attack when I was checking my pockets and realized i did not have my phonee on me. The last place I had it was in front of a 7 11 when i was smoking a cigarette sitting on the curb in front of it. I panicked and quikly went back to the curb and there was nothing. My girlfriend at the time thought we might as well ask the store worker if he had seen anything, and by this time I had already admitted defeat. To my surprise HE HAD IT! He had said someone turned it in saying it was just outside on the floor. This was when I realized what they say are true, in terms of the Japanese being very nice people. At the end of the day crisis everted! Thank you random stranger!</p>

                        <p>Before even going to Japan, I was always a big sushi fan. In my opinion, I always loved the actual sushi pieces, rather than the actual rolls. The sushi pieces are basically when the cut of whatever fish you get is on top of the rice. Anyways, This was my first conveyer belt sushi ever and the fact that is also in Japan made it so much better. When you sit down there is a tablet in front of you containing the whole menu. This is the tablet in which you order whatever you want from the menu and within minutes, on the conveyer belt that is also in front of you, your food will arrive. The only thing that doesnt arrive are drinks in which a server will come and bring it to you. I think the best part of the whole experience is the fact that the sushi pieces were equivalent to about only $1 per piece. Over here you get about $6-$9 for 2 pieces which makes it so much worth it, and it tastes just as good, if not better.</p>

                        <p>During my stay in Japan I had attended an electronic music festival called EDC Japan. EDC stands for Electric Daisy Carnival and it is based off of the really big festival that happens in Las Vegas every year. The festival was 2 days and the venue was at a baseball stadium in which there were 3 stages with the biggest being insidew the actual baseball stadium. It was really cool since one of the stages was even on the sand so you were right next to the ocean.</p>
